# Formula 1 Data Exploration

## 1.Background and Motivation
<p align = "justify"> Formula One (F1) is one of the most exciting and high-profile sports in the world, with a global fan base of millions. The sport's popularity is fueled by its high-speed, adrenaline-fueled action, as well as its history and prestige. F1 racing involves cutting-edge technology, precision engineering, and world-class drivers, all of which come together to create a thrilling and unpredictable spectacle. 
    </p>
  
<p align = "justify"> In recent years, the F1 world has seen a surge in the amount of data generated by the sport. From telemetry data to race results, there is a wealth of information available that can be used to gain insights into the sport and help teams and drivers optimize their performance.
    </p>

<p align = "justify"> This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of F1 data using SQL to answer several research questions. To achieve this, a large and diverse dataset that contains historical data on F1 races, teams, drivers, and track conditions will be leveraged and SQL queries will be used to extract relevant data from the database, transform it into meaningful insights, and visualize the results to facilitate interpretation and communication. his project will also involve cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is in a format that can be easily analyzed
     </p>

<p align = "justify"> The insights generated from this project could be useful for a wide range of stakeholders in the F1 ecosystem, including teams, drivers, sponsors, and fans. By understanding the factors that contribute to success in F1, teams and drivers can make data-driven decisions to improve their performance and gain a competitive edge. Sponsors could use the insights to identify potential opportunities for branding and marketing, while fans could gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of the sport they love.
    </p>

<p align = "justify"> Overall, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the performance of F1 teams and drivers and advance our understanding of the factors that contribute to success in the sport. By leveraging the power of big data and SQL, we can unlock hidden patterns and trends in the data that can inform decision-making and enhance our appreciation of this thrilling sport.

## 2. Research Questions
I have chosen the following reseach questions to focus on in this project:

1. Which constructor teams are the most successful in terms of total races entered and total points earned?
2. Which drivers are the most successful in terms of total points and wins?
3. Which country produces the most world champions?
4. Does higher altitude cause more engine failures in Formula 1 races?

## 3. Dataset: Data Retrieval and Standard Descriptive Analysis

The dataset used in the project is available at: [https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)

It contains race entries from 1950 to present. 

The dataset includes:

1. **circuits.csv:** This file contains data on all the circuits that have hosted a Formula 1 race.
2. **constructor_results.csv:** This file contains data on the race results for each constructor.
3. **constructor_standings.csv:** This file contains data on the final constructor standings for each season.
4. **constructors.csv:** This file contains data on each constructor that has participated in Formula 1.
5. **driver_standings.csv:** This file contains data on the final driver standings for each season.
6. **drivers.csv:** This file contains data on each driver that has participated in Formula 1.
7. **lap_times.csv:** This file contains data on the lap times for each driver in each race.
8. **pit_stops.csv:** This file contains data on the pit stops made by each driver in each race.
9. **qualifying.csv:** This file contains data on the qualifying sessions for each race.
10. **races.csv:** This file contains data on each race, including the race's ID.
11. **results.csv:** This file contains data on the results of each race.
12. **seasons.csv:** This file contains data on each season of Formula 1.
13. **status.csv:** This file contains information about the status codes that can be assigned to a driver's car during a race.

## 5. Import the Data to SQL
